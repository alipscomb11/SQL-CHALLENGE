Data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis using SQL

1.	Title:  Module 9 Challenge-SQL

2.	Description:  The focus of the Module 9 Challenge is designing tables to hold data from multiple CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and    generate the code needed to answer questions about the data. Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis will be required to successfully complete the module. The following are the key areas covered:

a.	Data Modeling:
    i.  CSV files for are read correctly
    ii. Create an Entity Relationship Diagram using QuickDBD

b.	Data Engineering
    i.  Create a table schema for each of the CSV files
    ii.	Specify Primary Keys
    iii.Specify Foreign Keys
    iv.	Establish the correct table order

c.	Data Analysis
    i.  Using SQL, provide answers for the (8) Challenge Questions.

3.	Usage

a)	The SQL-Challenge file will have a Data folder that contains the CSV files, and an EmployeeSQL folder that contains the Quick DBD-Entity-Relationship-Diagram, and the Data Engineering and Data Analysis results. 
b)	In order to achieve the coding outputs described above, the script sequencing for the SQL-Challenge requirements are as follows:
    i.	 Inspect the CSV files
    ii.	 Create Table Schema 
    iii. Establish correct table order based on constraints (primary, foreign keys)
    iv.	 Using PgAdmin, Import each CSV file into the SQL table

4.	Dependencies
a.	Importing the correct .csv files and processing the table in the correct order is critical to enable code execution. 
b.	The correct use of key constraints, and table sequencing were very important with this Challenge and the ability to obtain the correct output.

5.	Known Issues: Issues with the script.
a.	After Exporting the schema from QuickDBD, there was significant debugging that was required in order to execute the code in PgAdmin.
